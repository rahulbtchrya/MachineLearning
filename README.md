This is my repository of Machine Learning and NLP code files. Majority of the python files are related to NLP, although there are some which cater to different areas as well.
Below is a brief description:

TwitterNLTK.py - This code file uses NLTK and Gensim libraries to classify twitter text tweets into racist or non-racist. We use a combination of Word2Vec and XGBoost to create and train the model.

TwitterTextBlob.py - This code file uses the TextBlob library to classify twitter text tweets into racist or non-racist.

TwitterDNN.py - This code file uses a model based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically Bi-directional LSTM cells to classify twitter text tweets into racist or non-racist.

TwitterSpacy.py - This code demonstrates the use of Spacy's built-in text classifier to classify twitter texts.

TwitterSpacyVec.py - This code uses a combination of Spacy's document vectors and XGBoost for classification of tweets. The vectors are obtained from Spacy's large english model "en_core_web_lg"
